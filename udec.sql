Victims are estimated to lose between $25,000 and $75,000 on average, per attack. However, it’s not only financial losses that victims should be concerned about, but also the fact that “the malware used by the criminal to infect organizations gives remote control over infected machines and can perform keylogging functions. This enables harvesting of a variety of information from infected machines, such as details on the companies’ operations, assets and intellectual property.</p>\n<p>“Such details could be worth much more than the thousands of dollars obtained by fraud,” Check Point says.</p>\n<p>Another alarming aspect was that some of the targets are energy and infrastructure companies, which the unsophisticated cybercriminal was able to easily breach. Not only was the attacker able to compromise the networks of several large organizations, but he also managed to distribute his malware globally and remain under the radar for a long while.</p>\n<p>“This highlights the need for all organizations to improve their security to protect against phishing and business email compromise scams, and to educate their employees to be cautious about opening emails, even from companies or individuals that they recognize,” Check Point said.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/08/15/get-rich-die-trying-case-study-real-identity-behind-wave-cyberattacks-energy-mining-infrastructure-companies/\" rel=\"noopener\">Checkpoint Report</a></p>\n<script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7167863529667065\" data-ad-slot=\"5871986787\" data-ad-format=\"auto\"></ins>\n<script>\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n</script>\n</div>'),(250,'punch','Buhari shunned official for undermining Osinbajo, says presidential aide','http://punchng.com/buhari-shunned-official-for-undermining-osinbajo-says-presidential-aide/','http://punchng.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/08222005/Buhari-Osinbajo-1024x683.jpg','August 16, 2017','2017-08-16 13:13:55.522393','<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Olalekan Adetayo </strong>and<strong> Kamarudeen Ogundele</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Tuesday disclosed that ailing President Muhammadu Buhari recently turned back a government official from London where he is currently receiving medical attention for trying to undermine the Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shehu said this in an interview on Channels Televi<em>sion’s</em> programme, Sunrise Daily.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He gave the example to buttress his position that there was no truth in claims that some ministers were shunning Osinbajo and reporting to Buhari in London where he has been since May 7.</p><div class=\"inserted_ad\">\n<script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7167863529667065\" data-ad-slot=\"4561673892\"></ins>\n<script>\n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n  </script>\n<style>\n.inserted_ad{\n	float:left;\n	margin-right:40px;\n	margin-bottom:10px;\n}\n\n@media (max-width: 767px) {\n  .inserted_ad{\n    text-align:center;\n    float:none;\n    margin-right:0;\n 	}\n}\n</style>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said the official, who he did not name, went to the President with some documents but he (Buhari) turned the official back.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said Buhari made it clear to the official that the man (Osinbajo) that was in charge of the country was in Abuja.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“It is not true that ministers are going to the United Kingdom and are reporting to the President. I am aware that a senior official had gone to President Buhari in the UK with some documents to treat and the President said ‘no, I won’t. The man responsible for the country is in Abuja, go back to him,’” he said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When told that there was the possibility for those appointed by the President to remain loyal to him, he said, “Anybody who says their loyalty will remain with the President who appointed them does not understand the country’s constitution.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Once the President has transferred power, if you are the Inspector-General of Police and the Acting President says ‘go and do ABC,’ you are fined if you don’t do it.

If it is a President that wants power for his own sake, he could probably have been giving directives from there. But he said ‘no, I can’t give directives. I have handed over to the Acting President,’” he added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shehu insisted that Buhari had not done anything wrong by not disclosing his health status.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said Nigerians could only hold him responsible if he had promised them earlier that he would make full disclosure of his health status in all circumstances.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shehu recalled that Buhari promised to declare his asset publicly and he did so despite advice from many lawyers that there was no basis for him to do so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Bamidele Faparusi, has advised those behind the resume or resign protest against President Buhari to shelve the agitation in the interest of the nation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to him, Buhari remains a stabilising factor in Nigeria, urging the protesters to pray for his speedy recovery instead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Faparusi, a governorship aspirant in Ekiti State, said the protesters should not feign ignorance about the complex ethnic groups in the country, adding that Buhari’s resignation would cause animosity and create tension.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a statement in Ado Ekiti, Faparusi, who agreed that the protesters had their rights as permitted under democracy, argued that the President had not contravened the constitution by seeking medical attention in London after transmitting power to Osinbajo.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“As much as I was not oblivious of the rights of Nigerians to protest against their leaders, one should not also shy away from stating the fact that our lives as a people are being governed by the constitution and cultural values.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“What worries me most is that these people are in this country when economic saboteurs and corruption merchants are on rampage raping our economy and common wealth to death and yet no such protest takes place.

This is because my wife hid it from me, and we don’t normally hide anything from each other, because we have been married for 50 years and we are still on honeymoon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Why the event is a surprise to me is that God also hid it for me. I had no inkling at all from my Daddy that something like this is happening. If God hid it from me, it must mean that He approved of it. My wife knows that if I had any idea about what is happening today, it will never happen. I would have stopped it long ago because who am I without Jesus Christ? If there is anyone to be celebrated, it should be Him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“People say I am humble, but people need to know where I am coming from. I cannot say I have any ability or wisdom. Everything has been the Lord Himself. When I was about 40 and I saw grey hairs on my head, I wondered why and God said I was carrying a burden that was not mine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“God said, ‘I am just using you as camouflage. People need to see someone. So, I am putting you forward so that I can do the work from behind.’ So, everything that is happening in RCCG, nothing is of Adeboye at all; it is all about God. So, for you to say you are writing a book about somebody that is nothing, someone who has almost zero beginning, from a poor family and passed through secondary school by God’s grace.  For God to allow today to happen without telling me, it can only be that He wants to draw your attention to Himself that if you allow Him, He will do great things, using you as camouflage.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adeboye said it was a miracle he was at the occasion as he had slept one hour a night during the seven-day convention of the church which ended on Sunday.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While appreciating people who wished he lived long, he said he would die when his assignment was over.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“All those who prayed for me to be 80, I said amen. Those who said 90, I said amen to them, but those who said I would be 100, I did not answer them. Then someone said I would live to 120 and I said what would God say I did wrong to keep me for another 50 years? I will go as soon as I finish my assignment,” he added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cleric lauded his wife for always standing by him, saying she was the greatest gift he had aside from the Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>Read also: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a href=\"http://punchng.com/i-consulted-adeboye-dolapo-before-accepting-vp-position-osinbajo/\">I consulted Adeboye, Dolapo before accepting VP position – Osinbajo</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While recounting a year when they both fasted for 40 days three times over an issue, Adeboye said his wife refused to back out when he asked her to stop.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“If you can find a woman that can stand by you with 40 days of prayer and fasting, first, second, third time and willing to go with you as long as possible, then I will classify your wife as second to mine. Without my wife, I cannot be  doing what I am doing today,” he said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cleric later presented his four children to the gathering, describing them as God’s gifts to his family.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Earlier, former President Obasanjo had narrated how he consulted Adeboye before accepting to run for President in 1999.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said after meeting Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu in South Africa, who encouraged him to go ahead, he sought counsel from Adeboye.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, “For doing nothing, I was sent to prison. I came out of prison, and some people came running after me to contest to be President of Nigeria. I wondered that the one I did before, what did I get out of it? Prison! And now, you want me to do another one, that will be double prison.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“And when you are at crossroads, you need the direction of God to know which way to follow. I prayed and fasted and wasn’t satisfied. I decided to go to South Africa to meet people I had high regard for: Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. Mandela said I should follow my instinct. Tutu said I should not be tired of serving my people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I came back home to see pastor. And I told my story. We prayed and he said you can go, when God tells me what I should tell you, I will call for you. I was surprised that Mandela and Tutu gave me answers on the spot, but he said I should go. When will God tell him?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“A couple of weeks or thereabouts, I was sent for and he said God had said I should go ahead. If there was any doubt in my mind, all were gone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I picked my Bible to read while returning home and it was the Book of Esther that I opened. I saw where Esther was told that maybe it is because of this that God has brought you here.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Obasanjo, who noted that politicians were supposed to influence the lives of the masses positively, said Pastor Adeboye had done more than politicians in this regard.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, “As politicians, we are supposed to touch lives, but, for Pastor Adeboye, he has touched more lives than politicians. He has been a man of God with a difference, whom I benefited from personally when I was consulting to contest the 1999 election.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He added that it was the wife of the General Overseer that invited him, without the knowledge of the husband, asking that Adeboye should forgive them for this.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Obasanjo said, “I was told not to reveal my coming here by Mummy (Adeboye’s wife). How can I come to you without calling you? But, that was the instruction. Until I am in this hall, I never see anything about this programme. That means we have committed sins by keeping this secret from you and we seek for forgiveness from you and I am sure we have been forgiven.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“While I was in prison, Abacha had said three of us–myself, Shehu Yar’Adua, MKO Abiola, none of us will come out alive. Two of them did not come out of prison alive, but I came out. Not because I was clever, good and upright. It was all because of the grace of God. Sir, I thank you for helping me to make the right decision at that crucial time of my life. He, who does not respect this man, does not respect God.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Acting President, Osinbajo, who was Adeboye’s protocol officer, said he accepted to run as the Vice-President after the cleric asked him not to reject the nomination.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Osinbajo, who also defended Adeboye’s use of private jet because the RCCG was in more than 180 countries of the world, second to Coca-Cola with branches in 200 countries, cited three different instances when the pastor influenced his life positively.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said his passport had been stolen in South Africa for about three months when Adeboye prayed for him and the thief returned it when he had lost all hope.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> The Acting President said about a month later, his second daughter, who was ill and at the point of death was healed after a prayer by the cleric.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Of course, many know that I am not a politician and I was not a politician when I was nominated to be the vice-president. What I told those who approached me was that I would speak with two people-my wife and daddy (Adeboye). People around me said he would say no. I was also quite certain that he would say ‘Don’t bother or let us just think about it’. But I was surprised when he told me that if I was nominated, I must accept it.

This was primarily driven by an additional 30 Mt of direct shipping ore from Australia, which was the major source of new fine-products entering the Chinese market.</p><p>Iron ore exports exceeded 1,513 Mt in 2016, compared with under 1,439 Mt in 2015, and the seaborne market was more or less balanced. The net increase in global trade was led by Australia, which contributed 44 Mt of incremental seaborne supply. The predominant products that entered the market were Pilbara blend fines and Carajas fines.</p><p>Producers of iron ore have reduced mining costs substantially over the past four years, says the report, and the mining industry as a whole now spends US$22/dmt less than it did in 2013 due to tightened capital controls, renegotiated contracts and the exit of high cost supply. The production-weighted average cost for the seaborne market was only US$34/dmt in 2016, and the lowest cost producer achieved US$23/dmt. </p><p>Iron ore exploration budgets fell in 2016 for the fourth consecutive year, with the estimated US$685 million expenditure representing a decline of US$460 million from 2015. Most of the fall can be attributed to Australia and China, which together accounted for almost half of the global decline.

This is how the best technology works - so simple and easy to use that not so long ago it would have seemed like magic.</p><p>But those of us concerned with improving the lives of people in developing countries know that there are systems behind the sorcery: policy systems that enable and reward innovation; economic systems that allow raw materials, components and finished goods to flow across borders; financial systems that secure investments and payments; regulatory and legal systems protecting workers and consumers.</p><p>Like any complex system, the digital transformation of our economies and societies requires a multiplicity of moving parts. The international community has a responsibility to promote more effective collaboration between these moving parts to avoid widening the divides between those positioned to reap the rewards of technological change and those that risk being left behind.</p><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in electronic commerce as both consumers and enterprises go online to find what they need. At UNCTAD, we estimate that global e-commerce grew from $16 trillion in 2013 to $22 trillion in 2015, at a time when world production and trade grew very slowly.</p><p>The trend is set to continue in the coming years. Digitalization will further transform what we do and how we do things. The rise of robots, automation, the emergence of completely new products, services and business models such as Uber and Airbnb, self-driving cars, smart grids and many more will create opportunities for entrepreneurs and businesses as well as bringing massive consumer benefits.</p><p>At the same time, this trend will disrupt existing practices in many areas, expose incumbents to competition, change the skill requirements of workers and lead to the loss of jobs in countries and sectors.</p><p>Like previous large-scale economic transitions the benefits will be immense, but they will not materialize through a smooth, cost-free process.</p><p>The effects will differ between countries, industries and people, depending on their ability to adapt and respond to the new digital economy. This increases the need for all countries, enterprises and people to carefully consider what actions to take in order to prepare as best as possible.</p><p>In the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is our common responsibility in the United Nations and other international organizations to provide the necessary support to those countries that are less equipped to face this transformation.</p><p>As we look toward how technology can be harnessed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the case of e-commerce provides a case in point. What does this transformative method of trade offer?</p><p>E-commerce can:</p><p>Become a driver of inclusive growth and sustainable development by empowering women as entrepreneurs and traders (<a title=\"SDG Goal 5\" href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/\" target=\"_blank\">Goal 5</a>: Target 7; \"<em>Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws\" and Target 8; \"Enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women</em>\")</p><p>Support productive activities, create decent jobs, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), including through access to ICT-enabled financial services (<a title=\"SDG Goal 8\" href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/economic-growth/\" target=\"_blank\">Goal 8</a>: Target 3)</p><p>Help MSMEs gain access to financial services (including online and mobile payments) and their integration into value chains and markets (including virtual marketplaces) (<a title=\"SDG Goal 9\" href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/infrastructure-industrialization/\" target=\"_blank\">Goal 9</a>: Target 3)</p><p>Contribute to significantly increasing the exports of developing countries, in particular doubling the share of global exports by Least Developed Countries by 2020 (<a title=\"SDG Goal 17\" href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/globalpartnerships/\" target=\"_blank\">Goal 17</a>: Target 11)</p><p>But the e-commerce divide is huge. While 60-80% of people in many developed countries already shop online, the equivalent share in most of the world\'s countries is below 3%.</p><p>An UNCTAD-led initiative, <em>eTrade for All</em>, which was <a title=\"News Item\" href=\"/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=1281\">launched at our Ministerial Conference in Nairobi in July 2016</a>, is a concrete example how the international community, in partnership with other stakeholders, can come together to make our support fit for purpose.</p><p>Current efforts are simply inadequate. They are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale. To raise a country\'s e-commerce readiness, a number of policy areas need to address holistically the development of affordable ICT infrastructure, logistics and trade facilitation, the legal and regulatory environment, payment solutions, skills development and entrepreneurship financing, as well as the funding of e-commerce innovation.</p><p>That is why a much more concerted approach is essential.</p><p>The <a title=\"eTrade for All\" href=\"/en/Pages/DTL/STI_and_ICTs/eTrade-for-All.aspx\">UNCTAD-led eTrade for All initiative</a> raises awareness of opportunities, challenges and solutions related to e-commerce in developing countries, mobilizes financial and human resources for e-commerce projects in developing countries; and strengthens coherence and synergies among partners\' activities.</p><p>The main tool is an <a title=\"News Item\" href=\"/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=1410\">online platform</a>, which can help developing countries and donors navigate the supply of technical and financial support available to foster e-commerce and digital trade, learn about trends and best practices, and to raise visibility for the various partners\' initiatives and resources. The platform was officially launched in April 2017 during the <a title=\"UNCTAD E-Commerce Week\" href=\"/en/Pages/MeetingDetails.aspx?meetingid=1271\" target=\"_blank\">UNCTAD E-Commerce Week</a> in Geneva.</p><p>More than 20 national and international organizations had joined the initiative as of February and we expect the group to expand during 2017. Some 25 private sector entities have also joined the <a title=\"eTrade Partners\" href=\"/en/Pages/DTL/STI_and_ICTs/eTrade-for-All/eTrade-for-All-Organization.aspx\">Business for eTrade Development initiative</a>, which helps public-private dialogue.</p><p>To make e-commerce a vehicle for sustainable development we need to connect the dots. There is a need to bring all relevant stakeholders together - as opposed to continuing our bad habit of working in silos - and to work simultaneously across different policy areas.</p><p>It is my hope that the approach applied by <em>eTrade for All</em> can be emulated in other areas where information and communications technologies should support the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>In this way, we will respond more effectively to the desire among people in developing countries to connect to the new world of technological progress and the prosperous future they deserve.</p>');
