or where there are favourable prospects for further development; or if it is expedient in the public interest to encourage the development and establishment of an industry in Nigeria.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He explained that an administrative suspension was placed on the processing of PSI applications in September 2015 to allow for a comprehensive review and reform of the incentive regime.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The minister explained that the Federal Executive Council had at its last meeting approved the lifting of the suspension, a new guideline and a revamped pioneer list.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said based on the revamped pioneer list, the government had added 27 key industries into the scheme and deleted two other industries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said that the government would review the list of pioneer industries once in every two years going forward.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enelamah said in line with the reform provisions, all additions would be included in the list immediately, and all deletions would be removed from the list in three years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He explained that a review of the list of pioneer industries and products was done to bring it in line with the economic realities as set out in the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The minister said the review of the scheme was aimed at increasing transparency and process efficiency, as well as improving the Federal Government’s ability to measure the impact of the incentive</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An analysis of the new guidelines showed that the government would grant companies making investments in qualifying industries and products a tax holiday from the payment of company income tax for an initial period of three years, with the possibility of an extension for one or two years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A total of 27 industries would benefit from the tax holiday and companies that would enjoy pioneer status are only those that ventured to invest in industries that were either non-existent at all, or the country did not have sufficient presence for its economic development.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 27 industries are mining and processing of coal; processing and preservation of meat/poultry and production of meat/poultry products; manufacture of starches and starch products; processing of cocoa; manufacture of animal feeds; tanning and dressing of leather; manufacture of leather footwear, luggage and handbags; manufacture of household and personal hygiene paper products.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the same vein, the government lifted the suspension of tax on manufacturing and printing ink; manufacture of plastic products (builders’ plastic ware) and moulds; manufacture of batteries and accumulators; manufacture of steam generators; and manufacture of railway locomotives, wagons and rolling stock.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also affected are the manufacture of metal-forming machinery and machine tools; manufacture of machinery for metallurgy; manufacture of machinery for food and beverage processing; machinery for textile, apparel and leather production.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Others are the manufacture of machinery for paper and paperboard production; manufacture of plastics and rubber machinery; waste treatment, disposal and material recovery; e-commerce services; software development and publishing; motion picture, video and television programme production.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They also affect the distribution, exhibition and photography; music production, publishing and distribution; real estate investment vehicles under the Investments and Securities Act; mortgage backed securities under the Investments and Securities Act; and business process outsourcing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Executive Secretary, Nigeria Investment Promotion Council, NIPC, Yewande Sadiku, said that companies that would enjoy pioneer status were only those that ventured to invest in industries that were either non-existent at all, or the country did not have sufficient presence for its economic development.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She said that pioneer status did not relate to only new industries or entrants to the economy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sadiku said under the new arrangement, businesses that have existed for several years in a particular sector may not enjoy the pioneer status, except such companies ventured into a brand new line of business covered under the list of 27 new industries and products.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She said, “The pioneer status actually applies to those involved in their first year of business or operations. Clearly those older than that would not benefit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Only people that have agreed to venture into those sectors that would enjoy the pioneer status, and not those that have been there for more than a year.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reacting to the development, the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the lifting of administrative suspension on Pioneer Status Incentives by the Federal Government would boost local production capacity of manufacturers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The President, ACCI, Mr. Tony Ejinkeonye, said this in an interview with our correspondent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ejinkeonye told our correspondent that the lifting of the suspension would increase productivity as well as stimulate the much-needed investments in the private sector.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He, however, warned that the government should put adequate measures in place to check any form of abuse that would threaten the successful implementation of the scheme.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, “We, in the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, really welcome the lifting of the suspension because it will go a long way to encourage local industries, most especially these identified industries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“It is really going to boost employment; it will increase the production capacity of these industries and much more release the much-needed capital for extension of production and manufacturing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“While we welcome the development, we must also sound a note of warning that for every government initiative that is good, there are always people both in government and in the private sector that will want to abuse the process.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“This is why it is important for the government not just to pronounce this policy but it should also make sure it is implemented. They should put adequate enforcement procedures or penalties in place to guide against abuse of this process. It has to be adequately regulated.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The President, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Dr Frank Jacobs, however, faulted the decision of the Federal Government, adding that the move would discourage investors from investing in the sector.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He told our correspondent in an exclusive interview that the timing of the policy was inappropriate and could reverse the gains already made from the implementation of the incentive in the recent past.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In practical terms, he argued, it would lead to loss of investment, reduction in manufacturing output, decrease in export proceeds, as well as reduction in government revenue.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also lamented that the new policy on pioneer incentive would affect the job creation objective of the government.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, “A careful look at vital evaluation metrics for ascertaining the position of Nigeria in the comity of top manufacturing and exporting countries in the world showed that we are still very far from being among the top twenty despite our numerous potential and endowments.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The truth is, since the inception of the policy, we have made reasonable achievements that have made us to be self-sufficient in the production of some products, employ more Nigerians, earn meaningful export proceeds and improved our competencies and capacities to take on the world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I therefore see no reason why the policy should be discontinued at this point. This is a clear case of policy summersault that is not good in any way for any economy in recession.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The only plausible argument in favour of this policy is the need to increase the IGR through the taxes that will be paid by these industries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“This is simply a short term gain that will erode enormous long term benefits with trickle down effects on all facets of the economy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Suffice to say that the policy if not reviewed in consultation with the operators will have devastating effects that far outweighs the short term gain.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When asked to explain the implication of the decision for the much needed investments in the economy, Jacobs said it would have grave consequence for the affected sectors and the economy as a whole.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, “The industry will experience loss of investment and price instability because ordinarily investment in industries takes minimum of four years before maturity and withdrawal of this incentive midway or before maturity is detrimental to the growth and development of the manufacturing sector.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">  <strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br/>\n</strong>All rights reserved.

I am the third of eight children. I am 18 years old. I attended Shalom Academy in Nsukka, Enugu State. My parents are not so rich but they gave me adequate care. My dad is a teacher. He also has a poultry farm. My mother works as a medical lab scientist in a district hospital.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>You became the first pupil in your school to earn A grade in all the subjects you sat for in WASSCE. What motivated you to achieve the feat?</em></strong></p><div class=\"inserted_ad\">\n\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7167863529667065\" data-ad-slot=\"4561673892\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px\"></ins>\n\n\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While I was in school, my priority was to make a wonderful result. I had clarity of purpose in what I wanted to achieve. My elder brother was the chief motivator. He made six As in his WASSCE last year. He told me I could do better than he did. He planted that goal to surpass his feat in me. Whenever I had a problem with my studies, he was always around to help me out. He practically taught me the techniques to excel in the subjects. He prepared my mind about the syllabus in SS3, who the teachers were and what would enable me to get the best from each of them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He told me I needed to put in extra efforts in whatever I was doing. On my first day in school, when I got to SS1, my chemistry teacher called me and told me certain things about my goal. He told me no one had ever made nine As in the school. He said he heard an inner voice that I could break the record. I was just laughing when he told me. I had a note which I titled, “My future WASSCE results.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wrote down my results on the note, filling As across all the subjects I was to sit for. I prayed to God to help me achieve the goal. My friends who saw the note said I was going crazy. But I told God to help me. Another teacher that helped me a great deal was my biology teacher. She prepared a study timetable for me to follow. She told me to study at least two hours at a stretch. The two teachers (chemistry and biology) told me my goal was achievable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Have you always had an excellent result like this?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By God grace, I have always excelled in my studies. My results were always among the best.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What did you say when you saw your outstanding result?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was overwhelmed with joy. It was a record-breaking result because no one had ever made that result in my school. On that day, I was sleeping. My brother came to wake me up and broke the news. When I saw it, I thought I was dreaming.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How many hours did you study daily?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In our school, we were mandated to observe our preparatory classes for day students. From 2.30pm to 4pm, I would go home to cook and do other things I needed to do till around 7pm. From 7pm till 10pm, I was always reading my books daily. Sometimes, I could set aside five or six hours to read.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How did you cope with the distractions from boys in school?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I never had a boyfriend. One thing I learnt along the line was that once one is serious with one’s studies, it will be difficult for boys to approach one for a relationship. When I was in SS1, one day I entered the class. There was this male classmate of mine who was always disturbing me. I was reading my book. We had just finished the computer practical. Others were discussing while I was reading my book. Then the boy said, “What’s the problem with you? Is it that you cannot rest, at least talk to people.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said I didn’t need to be reading every time. I was able to overcome the pressures of male pupils because I didn’t entertain any unserious talks. They knew me for that so they avoided me. Also, I was a day student, so I spent most of my time in class. We had preparatory classes by 4pm so I was always at home when I was not in school. This made it impossible for any boy to approach me. Maybe if I was in the boarding school, it would have been a different story. I am a quiet girl. Because I rarely had time to chat with others, they said I was a proud girl. But I taught a few of my classmates in my spare time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What subject was the most challenging for you and how did you overcome it?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think physics posed the greatest challenge. I always found it hard comprehending the subject. The situation changed when I got to SS3. Our physics teacher always gave us tests every week. If you failed the test, he would cane you. I was afraid of his cane. I then made up my mind to study hard. Along the line, I realised that physics was not even as difficult as I thought. Mathematics was easy for me. God was just helping me at every stage. I found out that I understood what I was taught quickly. We had five mathematics teachers. While in school, mathematics was divided into five areas. We had separate teachers for arithmetic, algebra, statistics, geometry and vector. Each of these subjects was taught separately. The way mathematics was split into five areas really helped me to have a thorough understanding of the subject. I usually excelled in my mathematics examinations even without studying. I love the subject so much.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How did you feel meeting the Enugu State governor?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I thank God for the privilege to meet the governor at my age. I am grateful to God for making it possible. Thousands of pupils in our state would like to meet the governor. For me, it is one of the most memorable moments of my life as I shook hands with the governor. The governor congratulated me and said the commissioner for education would reach out to me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Later, I was told that the governor had given me a scholarship to study in any university of my choice in Nigeria and a prize of N1m. I felt overwhelmed. I never believed that I would be a beneficiary of a scholarship. I appreciate the government for this noble gesture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What role did your parents play in your success?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My dad is an English teacher. He always encouraged us. He taught us English after school hours. He made sure I didn’t use a mobile phone. Once I got to secondary school, I neither used a phone nor had access to any gadget. It was a serious offence at home. It really helped me because if I had a mobile, I would have been distracted. I might have spent less time on my studies. My mum always encouraged me too. She told me that when she was my age, she excelled in her studies too. She emphasised that I could break the record. When I was in primary school, my father supported me with extra lessons at home. He also got part-time teachers for me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Do you think you are a genius?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don’t think I am one. I think anyone who studied hard and relied on God can make a similar feat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What is the next step for you?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I want to study medicine. I chose medicine because I believe it would enable me to save lives. It is also a noble profession.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What did you score in the UTME?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The UTME was out before I took WASSCE. I scored 266. I was discouraged when I saw the result because I felt I should have got above 300 marks. The good thing is that they also use the WASSCE result to select candidates. They grade prospective candidates, using 60 per cent for the UTME and 40 per cent for the WASSCE result. When I saw my UTME results, I was just praying to God to excel in WASSCE result a wonderful one. When our principal saw my UTME result, he didn’t believe that it was my result because he expected more from me. UTME was very easy for me and I was disappointed when I saw the score.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Which schools did you apply to?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I applied to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and Ebonyi State University. The universities have not started issuing admission letters. They have started uploading the results. The cut off mark for medicine is 290 or so in UNN last year. I checked my result and it was 319.6, so I am hopeful I would be admitted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Why don’t you study abroad instead?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I want to study in Nigeria first. I guess I am too young to study outside the country all alone. But I would like to do postgraduate studies abroad.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Was cramming part of your studying methods?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am not good at cramming books. I develop many codes to remember what I read.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What are the most remarkable lessons you have learnt from your success?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think the most important part of my success story is to do one’s best and to trust in God. I always believe that it’s only God that can enable me to fulfill my destiny.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br/>\n</strong>All rights reserved.

The university teachers complained that the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2013 has not been fully implemented.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, had in January inaugurated a 16-man committee to look into the agreement. The committee, headed by Mr. Wale Babalakin, was given the mandate to dialogue with ASUU, the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities and other relevant bodies, to engender sustainable peace and industrial harmony in tertiary institutions.</p><div class=\"inserted_ad\">\n\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7167863529667065\" data-ad-slot=\"4561673892\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px\"></ins>\n\n\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ASUU’s National President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, had noted that the Babalakin-led committee set up by the  government lacked the capacity to resolve the contending issues in the agreement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ogunyemi stated that the government had ignored the system, claiming that the political class send their children to private universities abroad, because public universities are in poor condition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The unresolved issues in the agreement and the 2013 MoU included funding for the transformation of government-owned universities and academic allowances.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Others are the registration of Nigerian Universities Pension Management Company, university staff school, fractionalisation and non-payment of salaries,’’ Ogunyemi said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The strike is ongoing as a meeting between ASUU and the Federal Government ended in a deadlock and both parties scheduled another meeting for this week. Stakeholders in the education sector are hopeful that Buhari’s arrival will end the strike.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Lassa fever resurfaces</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cases of Lassa fever were recorded in Lagos and Ogun states while the President was away. The first was recorded at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital on August 8. A resident doctor was infected with the disease while more than 100 hospital workers exposed to the patients were placed under observation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Chief Medical Director of LUTH, Prof. Chris Bode, said two of the initial patients that died in the hospital included a pregnant woman, who passed on after a bleeding disorder following stillbirth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the same vein, Kwara State also had a case of Lassa fever which killed one person. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Atolagbe Alegbe, noted that the state was on red alert, to deal with disease.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Supreme Court ends PDP crisis</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another major event that took place while Buhari was away was the Supreme Court verdict which affirmed the Ahmed Makarfi-led caretaker committee as the authentic chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For many months, two PDP factions (the other being Senator Ali Modu Sheriff faction) locked horns in a supremacy battle for the soul of the party.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> On July 12, the apex court in Abuja, declared the Ahmed Markarfi faction as the valid leadership of the party thus ending the lingering leadership tussle within the opposition party.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour, who read the judgment on behalf of the five-man panel of judges, set aside the earlier ruling of the Court of Appeal in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, which affirmed Sheriff as the chairman of the party. The Supreme Court held that the decision of the national convention of the party held on May 21, 2016, in Port Harcourt was right to have ousted Sheriff as the chairman of the party, being the highest decision-making organ of the party.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The PDP recently held its non-elective convention at the Eagle Square, Abuja on August 11. The convention organised amid fanfare had in attendance delegates from the 36 states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Notice to quit</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In June, another issue that took the front burner in Buhari’s absence was the notice to quit issued by some northern groups to the Igbo living in the North.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The northern youths ordered the Igbo to leave their region on or before October 1.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also called ‘the Kaduna declaration’, the northern youths urged northerners living in the South-East to return home.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They explained that their decision was based on pro-Biafran agitation championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The northern youths said the agitation “amounts to a brutal encroachment on the rights of those termed as non-indigenous people residing and doing lawful business in those areas illegally demarcated and defined as Biafra by the Igbo.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Saraki’s acquittal</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While many Nigerians were complaining about Buhari’s long medical vacation, a former Governor of Kwara State and current Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, who was charged with 18 counts of false assets declaration and other related offences since 2015, was discharged and acquitted of all the charges on June 14 by the Code of Conduct Tribunal sitting in Abuja.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The chairman of the two-man panel, Danladi Umar, ruled that there was no case against Saraki. The Federal Government, however, appealed the judgement, saying the judgment “effectively” overruled previous decisions of the Court of Appeal delivered with respect to Saraki’s trial and other criminal cases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The capture of Evans</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, during the President’s absence, the Nigerian Police Force recorded a milestone with the arrest of a notorious kidnapper, Chukwudemeje George Onwamadike, popularly called Evans. He was arrested by the police at his Magodo, Lagos home on June 11.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It took the efforts of a special squad of the police led by an Assistant Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, to arrest the kidnap kingpin. The arrest of Evans, notorious for collecting ransom in hard currencies, evoked relief and wild jubilation in the country. Evans evaded justice for years. He currently faces an array of kidnapping, armed robbery and drug charges as his operations have said to have spanned Abuja, Anambra, Edo, Rivers, Bayelsa and Lagos states where he unleashed terror on his victims over the years. He was said to have once kidnapped his boss’ daughter, collecting N22m as ransom. He then began collecting ransoms of between N50m and N100m Some of his victims included the proprietor of the Young Shall Grow Motors, Vincent Obianodo, James Uduji and Uche Okoroafor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Naira stabilises against dollar</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The stability of the naira against the dollar was among the remarkable developments that took place while Buhari went on medical vacation to the UK.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The naira’s considerable stability was heart-warming to many Nigerians as it now exchanges for N367 to the dollar, N473 to the pound, and N432 to  the euro.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The CBN had remained resolute in boosting liquidity in all the segments of the foreign exchange market. The apex bank created a special window for investors and exporters to have uninterrupted access to foreign exchange, a move stakeholders described as a right step.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Biafra Secret Service</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the President’s absence, the Indigenous People of Biafra established the Biafra Secret Service.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Members of the secret police, as seen in a viral video, were dressed in black attire and different shades of red berets, lined up in rows on a road somewhere in Abia State.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The police have, however, described the BSS as an llegal organisation and  that it would not be recognised by the government.  The Abia State Commissioner of Police, Adeleye Oyebade, stated that the Nigerian constitution recognises only the Nigerian police, Nigerian Army and the Department of State Services. He warned that the full weight of the law would be brought upon those backing the BSS.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The IPOB leader, Kanu, granted bail back in April and he is scheduled to return to court in October for a substantive hearing of his alleged treason charges.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shekau ultimatum</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An ultimatum was issued for the capture of Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, by the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen, Tukur Buratai, on July 22. The Army boss had ordered the Theatre Commander of Operation Lafiya Dole in the North-East, Maj.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, to produce the Boko Haram leader, dead or alive within 40 days.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Buratai further urged him to use everything in his arsenal to arrest the terror leader with an appeal to the public to also volunteer information that would lead to the accomplishment of this task.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Coup rumour</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After President Muhammadu Buhari departed Nigeria for the UK, there were rumours of an impending coup plot against his administration. In a swift move, Buratai, waded into the matter and promptly assured Nigerians that nothing of such would happen.

We thank the Almighty for saving his life and pray that He grants him better health and understanding on how to rescue our poor economy and relieve Nigerians from the current hardship.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also speaking on Saturday, the All Progressives Congress saluted the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, for leading the country well when Buhari was out of the country.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ruling party stated this in a statement signed by its Spokesperson, Bolaji Abdullahi, in Abuja.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The statement said, “APC welcomes the President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari back home after his medical vacation to the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The party thanks the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, for his competent leadership in the absence of President Buhari and especially commends him for his effort to unite the country and drive the recovery of the national economy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The APC also thanks all Nigerians who had prayed ceaselessly for the speedy recovery and safe return of the President, assuring them that the APC-led Federal Government is poised to fulfil all the electoral promises the party made to Nigerians.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, said although nothing tangible had changed since Buhari’s departure, Osinbajo did well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group claimed that the menace of herdsmen reduced while Osinbajo was acting president.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Overall, we will give Osinbajo a 50 per cent mark,” Afenifere spokesperson, Yinka Odumakin, said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Second Republic lawmaker, Junaid Mohammed, also said Osinbajo deserved commendation for the roles he played during Buhari’s absence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While giving a scorecard of Osinbajo’s performance, Mohammed said the Vice President was “able to hold the ship of the nation steadily.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He advised Buhari to carry the All Progressives Congress along in his government and not to sideline major stakeholders of the party.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, “I express the nation’s gratitude to Osinbajo. I have to be very careful about showering praises on him because he was not alone. But by and large, I am glad to say congratulations to him because he has not created any crisis on his own.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The area he could have caused crisis was his unique interpretation of hate speech, something which is not even in the constitution not in any of the country’s laws. It was his own invention but thank God it’s not going to stand the test of time because quite a number of lawyers have condemned it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I don’t believe Buhari could have achieved what Osinbajo did in his absence. The basic contradiction is that he is a sick man. Sick men are not assessed on the basis of their performance. But the comparison is baseless because it’s not Osinbajo who was elected. As far as I am concerned, Osinbajo came in as a very good number two for the country, not necessarily for Buhari. I hope he continues to be loyal to the country.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br/>\n</strong>All rights reserved.

It is good to see him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“As you can see from many Nigerians who lined up on the road to receive the President as he came back, they are happy that the President is hale and hearty and that he has come back.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“It was a natural reaction. Most people heard of his arrival only a few hours before then, but as you can see, the response was so spontaneous. So, I think that people were excited and very happy.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, speaking with reporters at the airport, the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum and Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, described Buhari’s return as the moment Nigerians had been waiting for.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, “This is the moment that Nigerians have been waiting for over 90 days. As governors, we paid him a visit in London and we reported what we saw to Nigerians. We pray to God to give the President good health and for him to continue to manage the economy.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When asked how the President’s return is expected to impact on the polity, the governor said, “It will impact seriously because the country is just like a body. When the head is cut off, the body will not make any meaningful achievement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The fact that he has a vibrant vice president who can work effectively when he is not around does not mean you can compare the difference between when he was not around and when the two of them are around. His return will impact on the economy and it will impact on the security. It means so many things will change.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, noted that things would be done quickly with Buhari’s return.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, “Nigerians are happy and we are happy.

This has put paid to the various views being expressed. He has had enough time to ponder over several issues. There are many expectations from Nigerians. They want to know what next.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I also want to commend Osinbajo for being so committed and faithful to his boss. In our clime, this is rare.

He urged Nigerians to desist from playing politics with health issues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The governor said, “We are happy that he is alive and that is why l am here today to rejoice with the family.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“We should not play politics with everything. We are here talking about health and irrespective of the party l belong to, you can see that l am here today to rejoice with the family.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“That is how it is supposed to be. Don’t play politics with health issues, don’t do that.

We are closer to the people, so we must lead by example. It is important to find a way of addressing the yearning of our people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Without the people, there cannot be a leader. We can see clearly what is wrong with the present system. The people and all the major political parties are calling for restructuring. We should allow people to develop at their own pace. It is the only way out of a potential crisis. That is how we can address all the agitations across the country. We support the restructuring of the nation,” the monarch, who spoke through his Director, Media and Public Affairs, Adeola Oloko, said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another first-class traditional ruler from Eket, Akwa Ibom State, Obong Etim Abia, noted that reforming the country’s economic policies to make it more buoyant was not the focus of the call for restructuring.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I think the general opinion is that, as Nigerians, we all need to come together, sit down and discuss how we want this country to be governed. This is the only country in the world that people have to go to the centre and share money. Things cannot continue like that — that is why some people insist on resource control.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“To say the country should not be restructured and that we should leave it to what the military decided to make it — with the military all from one side of the country — is unfair and unrealistic. We must agree on resource control in which every state will control its own resources and give a percentage, even if it is 50 per cent, to the centre,” Abia said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also weighing in on the matter, the paramount ruler of Aburemi Kingdom, Ogbia, Bayelsa State, King Collins Daniel, told <em>SUNDAY PUNCH </em>that he disagreed with the Sultan, arguing that only restructuring would address the perennial problems of the country.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Daniel, a first-class monarch, said he did not buy into the idea of building dams across the country as the solution to the restructuring Nigerians were calling for.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The man (Sultan) who is talking about building dams across the nation is talking in respect of the Sahel region. You know this country is divided into different geographical regions. You have the savannah; you have the Sahel, the forest and the swamps. You will find out that most of the Niger Delta states are in the swamps, lowlands; the South-East and the South-West are in the forest region. The Middle Belt is in the savannah and the North-East and the North-West are in the Sahel region. Now the problem of someone that is in the North-East or North-West cannot be the same problem of the people in the swamp region; it cannot be the same with the people in the forest region.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“So, what is the significance of dams? What will dams do? Dams are for those who don’t get enough rains. The northerners don’t have enough water, so they need dams. So, if that is the solution to their problem, that cannot be the solution of Nigeria. There is always a unifying force for people to say, ‘Let there be restructuring.’ People should be able to negotiate on this structure that we have, so that a section of the country does not have undue advantage over other sections of the country,” the Ogbia monarch said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladelusi Aladetoyinbo, a paramount ruler in Ondo State, there are many imbalances in the Nigerian system and only restructuring can correct them. He told our correspondent that no monarch should ignore restructuring demands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I must say that we cannot shy away from the restructuring of this country. Remember that we are talking about an equitable society where we will all see ourselves as one and not a lopsided situation as we currently have. We need to restructure the political frame of the country; the fiscal federalism must equally be addressed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“We must, therefore, look for a way to discuss these challenges and the best way to overcome them is by the restructuring of Nigeria,” the Deji of Akure said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, an Ekiti monarch, the Ajero of Ijero, Oba Adebayo Adewole, argued that, contrary to the view of the Sultan, the country would not progress without political restructuring.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oba Adewole said, “I believe strongly in restructuring. There is no need for a region to be dragging another region behind. Each state should develop at its pace and control its resources.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“This is why the Niger Delta people are agitating; they feel they are the ones generating the wealth of the nation and their region is not developed. If Nigeria is restructured, the economic and security challenges will go away.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, a first-class traditional ruler from Imo State, Obi of Ihim, Eze Oliver Ohanwe, noted that the northern monarch’s preference for economic restructuring would not bring about equity, fairness and justice that Nigerians are clamouring for.  He asserted that anything aside full restructuring would continue to undermine the unity of the country.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I do not agree with the Sultan of Sokoto with his take on restructuring. We need to restructure the country. Agitations for the restructuring of the country did not start today. They started during the amalgamation in 1914 — most Nigerians support restructuring of the country.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the same vein, the Okirika-Ama, Umuokirika in Ahiazu Mbaise Local Government Area of the state, Eze Dom Okoro (Eze Okirika I) told <em>SUNDAY PUNCH</em> that he was not surprised that the Sultan did not throw his weight being the restructuring that many Nigerians wanted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, “I say this because they (northerners) are beneficiaries of the current distortions in the country.  By that campaign from the Sultan, they want the existing imbalance and cheating in the country to continue.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">His view was shared by another paramount ruler, Dr. Ikechukwu Okoligwe, (Okukoro II) of Awo-Idemili in Orsu Local Government Area, Imo State.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The monarch said, “Many Nigerians are calling for restructuring for us to have equity and fairness in the country. If we fail to do that, we would be deceiving ourselves.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, told <em>SUNDAY PUNCH </em>that he agreed with the Sultan’s call for economic restructuring.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I sat with the Sultan and he explained what he meant to me. He explained everything about the devolution of the economy to me and I agreed with him. If restructuring is about breaking up the country, I am against it. But if it is about how to improve the welfare of the people, I will support it,” he stated.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oba Akanbi added that there should be a clear understanding of the restructuring being called for.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“So many people do not understand what the restructuring is about. Many think it is about the break-up of the country and the people must be educated that the restructuring they are clamouring for is not to break up the country.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“What I would advocate is industrialisation. This government must do everything to ensure that Nigeria is industrialised. The kind of agriculture we are practising in Nigeria is wasting our produce. Farmers lose 75 per cent of their produce after harvest,” he said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br/>\n</strong>All rights reserved.

We courted for two years and got married on December 4, 2004.</p><div class=\"inserted_ad\">\n\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7167863529667065\" data-ad-slot=\"4561673892\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px\"></ins>\n\n\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What were some of the qualities that endeared you to your wife?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq:</strong> I can’t really be specific in terms of the qualities that attracted me to her but as we continued the journey, I discovered many things that made it smoother- she is a godly person and a disciplinarian. She is also a very hardworking lady.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How would you describe your marital journey over the years?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> I would attribute the success of our marriage to the God factor in our lives and give Him all the glory. He has been the foundation of our home and everything therein. Without him, we wouldn’t have been able to come this far.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq:</strong> Our journey has been smooth to the glory of God. There is a popular Yoruba adage that whoever wants to get married must be prepared for the task ahead. The Almighty God brought us together as one, we started the journey with him and he has always been there for us and we are thankful for that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What was the feeling like when you became parents for the first time?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> It was a wonderful experience and God has been able to help us in raising our kids in the way of the Lord. For instance, whenever I’m supposed to be on set, I always enlist the help one of our female apprentices who will come and stay with them for about four or five days while I am on set. My husband might be around at the time, especially when he is not on set at the same time with me but I just need an extra eye to look after the children.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq:</strong> Fatherhood has been a wonderful experience; especially when you have the kind of support structure that I have through my wife. I enjoy being a loving and responsible father as well as a doting husband.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What do you think is responsible for the spate of marital breakups these days and how can they be reduced?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> In the first place, let me state that problems in marriages vary from couple to couple. Having said that, what I always tell people is that before embarking on the marital journey, put God first in all things and He’ll direct you in the way that you should go. After you have consummated your union, He should also be the foundation, centre and life of your home and He’ll surely take control of everything and there wouldn’t be any cause for alarm as you both go along in the marriage. If God is not present in a marriage, <em>na real wahala</em> at home (there will be problems in such a home) because marriage is not a bed of roses. You must be able to sacrifice in all things, not some things to make the marriage work. Sacrifice should be the key word here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq:  </strong>On my part, I would say that lack of trust and tolerance are contributory factors to the breakup of marriages. If couples can learn to tolerate and have implicit faith and trust in one another, they won’t have issues in their homes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>There are times when the both of you have to be on the same set to shoot a movie; how do you put aside your personal relationship and wear the toga of professionalism as actors?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> When you call yourself a professional, you must be very good at what you do, irrespective of your personal relationship with someone on a particular set so there is usually no cause for alarm. When I’m on set with my husband, I no longer see him at that moment as my spouse because he has taken up another person’s character and he doesn’t see me as his wife as well. We act according to what the script says. After the whole acting stuff, we can now switch back to our husband and wife mode and that’s it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq:</strong> For me, the feeling is always a neutral one because the script will always determine how we will act on set, even if we are both casted as a copy. At that point, the script is the most important thing when we are going on set, it is not about Moji or Rasaq because a job has to be done in the most professional manner as possible and that’s what matters the most.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How do you usually celebrate your wedding anniversaries?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> We always celebrate them in a low-keyed manner because we are not loud people. For those who know me up close and personal, I hate noise and I am not the lousy type. Hence, we always celebrate very quietly. We could be in our living room with our children. We’ll eat, drink and make merry. We’ll also go to church to thank God in a thanksgiving service. Our wedding anniversary this year would be in December and we are looking forward to another memorable celebration by God’s grace.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq:</strong> Wedding anniversaries are always quietly celebrated for us. Nothing elaborate  really.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What’s your husband’s favourite food?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> My husband eats a lot- he loves to eat bread, wheat flour and other solid food spiced with well-prepared vegetable soup and assorted meat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq:</strong> Just like my wife said, I love wheat flour, beans, fruits and vegetables.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Couples usually have squabbles and moments when they disagree; in your own case, who usually apologises first?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> We always apologise to each other and end everything in the bedroom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>As a beautiful woman, how do you ward off advances from men?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> Just like every other lady out there, I use God’s wisdom to deal with such situations and it works perfectly for me. I don’t have any problem with my male counterparts and I thank God for that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How would you describe your personalities?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> I’m a God-fearing woman, kind and very hardworking. I firmly believe in the power of prayers and I’m also an extrovert.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq: </strong>I’m an easy-going man and I don’t joke with my career so I always put my best foot forward at all times. I am gentle among my friends but delicate among my enemies. People often call me RR (Ruggedy Rasaki) because of my ruggedness and I don’t believe in impossibilities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Your husband has carved a niche for himself in Nollywood as one who brilliantly pulls off the role of an old man in most movies,  do you sometimes feel that he’s stereotyped?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> I don’t think so because that is where versatility comes into play. If he accepts a script for instance, he is at liberty to play any role that he is given. Even though he plays the role of an old man most of the time, he still brings out the best of him to play other roles as well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What would be your advice to prospective couples who are still in courtship/preparing for marriage and those who are already married in terms of keeping their homes?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> For the unmarried ones, especially the ladies out there-if you want to get married, be prayerful. Put everything before God, let him direct and choose your partner for you and you will surely choose right. To the married ones, let me reiterate that marriage is not a bed of roses-it takes a lot of hard work and prayers to make it work.  Hence, you must put in your very best to make it work.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq:</strong> Couples should endeavour to build their homes on love and trust but most importantly, put God first-they should seek the face of God before anything else.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Do you both keep a joint account as a couple?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> No, we keep separate accounts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How do you relax when you are not working?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> When I’m at home, I watch a lot of movies, I play with our children and I love to cook for my husband. Those are the things that I do when I’m off the camera. I also unwind by writing scripts and I’m working on one at the moment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq: </strong>I spend my free time with my wife and children because she doesn’t like noise at all-she is a very quiet and private person.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Your late father, Adeyemi Afolayan aka Ade Love was a great entertainer during his lifetime, what are some of the things that he taught you about life and the school of marriage?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji: </strong>I remember so many things about my father, he was a loving father and if I continue to eulogise him, I won’t stop. He was a man in a million. When he was alive, he advised me to look before I leap when I’m going to get married and I shouldn’t let my love be blind whenever I was going to choose a life partner and I adhered strictly to his words of wisdom and it worked out perfectly for me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Should couples engage third parties when settling their squabbles or endeavour to settle them on their own?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> I’ll give you a two-pronged answer- Firstly, I wouldn’t advice couples to call in a third party to settle their problems but all the same, they can’t settle all problems on their own. At such moments, they should look for people who are more knowledgeable than they are to help them out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Which is more important in a marriage; finance or love?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rasaq:</strong> I think both are important. However, money cannot buy love but love can buy everything.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moji:</strong> Both elements are important to sustain a home but in the right proportion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br/>\n</strong>All rights reserved.

He has a beautiful baritone voice and I remember him singing Christian hymns in Yoruba while I was a child.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Your father is a biology professor while your mother is a pharmacist and you are a pediatrician. Did your parents influence your career choice in that regard?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course they did. Science was always part of our house and a frequent topic of conversation. We grew up going to the laboratory when my parents were graduate students and during their career, I watched them run experiments. While I had no desire to do research, science has always been a passion for me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Where were the places he took his family to for relaxation?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We usually went on a lot of road trips to visit family friends. One of my favourite trips was when we took an impromptu trip to Niagara Falls and a boat ride tour under the waterfalls. My father took me to my first American football game when I was seven years old.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How did he create time for his family despite his busy schedule first as a lecturer and then a politician?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He is spontaneous. On the day of my son’s first birthday, he flew overnight from Nigeria to celebrate with us and surprised us late in the night on the doorsteps. The rest of my family members had been planning to come but I had no idea that my father was coming. It was a wonderful present from him. He is a type of man who will do that sort of thing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How does he like to relax?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He loves to watch movies and play the word game Scrabble. One of the favourite things I did try to do with him is try to beat him in scrabble game. But it was extremely difficult.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Did his family fear for his life at anytime particularly when he started going deep into politics?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I do not particularly remember much of the details when he was involved in political activism. But I do remember when he was broadcasting on <em>Radio Kudirat</em> from our kitchen phone, I was worried (I was in middle school) that he would get into trouble. At the time, my 13-year-old mind did not quite understand the gravity of what he was doing at the time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Did he ever visit you in school?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since he is a biology professor, he was invited to lecture to my AP chemistry class during my senior year in high school. I was alternately abashed (as any teenager would be) and extremely proud of how well received he was by my friends.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Did you get preferential treatment from your colleagues and teachers when you were in school?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Never. I did not get any preferential treatment from my colleagues and teachers when I was in school. Most of them had no idea who my father was at the time. Even now, it always takes them by surprise when they find out his position in government.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now<em>, </em>it takes people aback when they find out who my father is. Most of my friends in the United States are intrigued by the idea of having a father who is a senator. They always want to know more about him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What is his idea of punishing any child who behaved?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be honest, the worst punishment from my father was when he would talk very quietly to any child who misbehaved. That was how one knew he was very angry and disappointed. And then we would get left alone or lose a privilege.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Can you recall when he beat you and what you did if he ever used the cane?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having to “stoop” in the corner of the room was the worst punishment that my father ever gave me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Did he counsel his children on the kind of person to marry?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our parents used to raise dust in a way that I believe caused us to have good judgment as to choosing our spouses. I do not remember any specific conversations that we had, but I knew that whoever I would bring home to meet my parents would have to be very special.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What kind of music does he like to listen to?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father likes to listen to any gospel music. He also enjoys the music of King Sunny Ade.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What is his work schedule like?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father’s work schedule is erratic, as far as I can tell. He is a very hard-working person and often has irregular working hours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How has your father’s name opened doors for you?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the United States, especially since he tends to spend most of his time in Nigeria, and since I have change my maiden name after marriage, most of my daily interaction is not influenced. In Nigeria it is a different situation. His name makes things more comfortable in general.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Who were the regular faces in your house while you were growing up?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember that Uncle (Prof.) Wole Soyinka usually visited us several times. That was always a treat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What are the ideals you have learnt from him?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the values I have learnt from my father is to show integrity in everything I do. Also, I have imbibed generosity from him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How close are you to him?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father and I are close and I go to him and my mother for counsel and support.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What is his favourite drink?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father’s favourite drink used to be Fanta I think. But he does not drink soda anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What is his favourite food?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father’s favourite meal is anything that my mother makes for him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How sociable is he?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He is always the life of the party. He is very often invited to speak at weddings and social events. He has the gift of the garb. He is also a brilliant orator. My father has a charity for orphans called Sarah’s Home named after his late mother.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>What kind of father is he?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father is someone that is firm, uncompromising and generous. He once took a Chinese cooking class and made us dumplings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How did you feel when he won his party ticket to contest for the Osun Central senatorial seat and eventually won the election?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am proud that he dealt with injustices and continued to tackle corruption in a manner that was consistent with his political career thus far.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Your father once described the nation’s federal lawmakers as ‘legislooters.’ Do you think he still holds the same view now that he is fully part of them as a member of the Senate?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I still consider my father to be one of the few honest men in Nigerian politics. As he has been doing since he was a graduate student at the University of Georgia, he continues to combat corruption.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Did he tell you why he participated in the stoppage of the third term agenda of former President Olusegun Obasanjo?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No. he did not tell me why he was involved in the stoppage of the third term agenda of ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How do you feel whenever he expresses his view on the state of the nation?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am proud that he lives and breathes for Nigeria.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>How does he handle disagreements with his wife?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father handles disagreements with his wife with laughter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br/>\n</strong>All rights reserved.
